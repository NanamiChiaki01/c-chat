# c-chat

When the client is being executed, I want to show user a menu to create accrount or login. User can have simple username that supports alphabet and numbers only. Once the user is logged in, they can have the option to join the chatroom, or to create a chatroom. The chatroom can have chatroom name, the user should be prompt to choose it on chatroom creation. once the user created the chatroom, show them a menu that allows them to choose if to join that chatroom, create another new chatroom, or join another existing chatroom by chatroom name
